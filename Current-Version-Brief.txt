Changes made to first version:
1.) Made the code modular by adding functions.
2.) New version allows scheduling in advance so user doesn't have to run the code before every class.
3.) Ask confirmation from user to join the class.

Scope for Improvement:
1.) Terminate the program after last class is launched
2.) Run the code automatically on log in.
3.) Currently if user logs into pc at time >= a class time then that class is not launched. That is if user is late 5 mins for the first class
    then first class will not launch. There no problem with next classes only first class has the problem.
4.) Give user the option whether he wants a confirmation before every class or not
5.) Ability to reschedule a class if it is cancelled.
6.) Currently the code has to be run for every log into the pc. Make it so that once run for the day the schedule for next classes is saved
    and on restarting resumes from there. 
7.) User may have two accounts in browser. The class should be joined by the account the user wants.
